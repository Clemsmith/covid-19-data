### Project structure
The project contains two independent directories:

- [`public/data`](public/data): Contains the final datasets. This is for people interested in consuming the data and
  understanding all the caveats about it and its metrics.
- [`scripts`](scripts): Contains all the code and intermediate files to produce the final dataset. This is for people interested in
  contributing to the project or better understanding our internal technical processes.
